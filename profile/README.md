## SwiftyAI

AI is evolving rapidly, transforming industries by automating tasks, enhancing decision-making, and personalizing user experiences. For iOS and macOS developers, itâ€™s becoming crucial to understand how to leverage AI in their applications. Although Appleâ€™s platforms offer powerful machine learning tools like Core ML, other open source solutions now exist like [mlc-llm](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm/) and [mlx](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples). Keeping up with AI advancements ensures apps remain relevant, provide better user experiences, and harness the full potential of evolving technology.

SwiftyAI aims to explore what is available to iOS and macOS developers with a focus on open source and local capabilities.
